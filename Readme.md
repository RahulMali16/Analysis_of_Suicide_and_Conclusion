# Data Analysis of Suicides in India

Every year, 7-8 Lakh people globally die by suicide, with many more attempting it. Each suicide is a personal tragedy with devastating ripple effects on families, friends, and communities. The World Health Organization recognizes suicide as a serious public health problem, yet it's preventable.  This project analyzes suicide trends in India and explores the relationship between suicide rates and various factors to understand the root causes of increasing suicide rates.  By identifying these patterns, we aim to inform necessary actions to prevent suicides and decrease the suicide rate in India.

**Project Motive:** To analyze suicide trends in India and investigate the influence of factors like gender, age, occupation, and education on suicide rates.  This analysis seeks to uncover root causes and propose preventive measures.

**Required Libraries:**

*   NumPy
*   Pandas
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn

This project uses these libraries for data processing and visualization to gain valuable insights from the dataset.
